## Researching and Testing the Scalability of Monolothic and Microservices applications on Cloud Networks

Final year project looking into the difference between how a "older" monolithic architecure scales on the cloud compared to the "modern" microservice architecture. Measuring and testing certain metrics such as elasticity, scalability and efficency of the architectures.

### Code Base
Big thanks to TeaStore - https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore

This is a great open source benchmarking testing application that can be used as a single monolithic but also a microservice.

The code has been ported to this repo and changed accordingly.
